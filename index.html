        <h2>THE SPIRITUAL ASPECT OF LIFE</h2><br>
    <div class="head">What is the importance of spiritual aspect in your life?</div><br>
       <p> Healthy spirituality gives a sense of peace, wholeness and balance among the physical, emotional,
         social and spiritual aspects of our lives.<br> However, for most people the path to such spirituality passes
         through struggles and suffering, and often includes experiences that are frightening and painful.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="head">What is a spiritual way of life?</div><br>
            <p>Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is something greater
             than myself, something more to being human than<br>
             sensory experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in nature.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <div class="head">What is spirituality in your own words?</div><br>
                <p>Spirituality is the broad concept of a belief in something beyond the self. It may involve religious
                 traditions centering on the belief
                 in a higher power,<br> but it can also involve a holistic belief in an individual connection to others and to the
                  world as a whole.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <div class="head">Spiritual well-being affects overall quality of life, which includes the following areas:</div><br>
                    <p>physical well-being: functional ability, strength/fatigue, sleep/rest, overall physical health, nausea, appetite, constipation, and aches and pains<br>
                    social well-being: family distress, roles/relationships, affection/sexual function, appearance, employment, isolation and finances<br>
                    psychological well-being: control, anxiety, enjoyment/leisure, pain distress, happiness, fear, and cognition/attention<br>
                    spiritual well-being: meaning of illness, uncertainty, hope, religiosity, transcendence, and positive change<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Spirituality is that part of yourself that helps you find meaning, connectedness and purpose in your life. It can 
                    include the practice of a philosophy, religion, or way of living. During difficult times, people often
                     look for meaning and connectedness in the greater scheme of things to
                     help them understand and cope with their experience. Serious illness can be one of those times.<br>
                     <br>
                    Research shows that spirituality is related to better health outcomes. Spirituality seems to help people cope with
                     illness, suffering and death. Spirituality also influences end-of-life decisions. All people, with or without a
                      connection to organized religion or any spiritual practices, seem to benefit from finding their own sense of meaning,
                       purpose and connectedness.</p>
